    "There are several limitations using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you look at the above examples, most of the functions have similar logic to iterate through elements.\n",
    "* We are spending more time on coding non business logic.\n",
    "* It results in too much of code and it can become a maintenance problem.\n",
    "* Map Reduce APIs will solve these problems.\n",
    "  * We do not have to develop loops and conditionals.\n",
    "  * Loops and Conditionals are taken care by the existing APIs.\n",
    "  * We can just focus on business logic. It can be passed using Lambda Functions."
